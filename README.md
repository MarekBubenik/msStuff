# Dev

A collection of scripts and tools I have gathered or made. Mostly Powershell stuff.

## Usage - basic scripts

- Always read notes in scripts themselfes but for the most part you usually execute scripts like:

```
& .\simpleScript.ps1
```

- or

```
& .\simpleScript.ps1 "FIRSTPARAMETER" "SECONDPARAMETER"
```

## Usage - remediation scripts

- Remediation scripts are to be used within Intune - Remediation section
- Remediation scripts always have **detection** and **remediation** files

## Notes

- A lot of stuff is left and not uploaded to this repository because it contains sensitive and company branded files
